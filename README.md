# odin-recipes
This project is a site where there are:
- 1 index page
- 3 pages, one for each recipe
It was only used HTML to build this project, along with elements such as:
- <a> to redirect the user to the recipe's page and back to the index one.
- <ul> to show the ingredientes required.
- <ol> for the step-by-step section.
- <p> for the description of the recipe.
Although it's a simple project, it's good to understand how to structure a website using HTML.
